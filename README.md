# Timed-Quiz

A timed quiz about fundamental Javascript knowlwdge

This project makes use of a lot of Js knowledge I have learned and requires significant research and experimenting time to make things work.

Things I successfully make happen:
  Set the Start Quiz button so that when clicked, questions sequentially show up.
  Questions show up in order.
  Set timer that starts from 100 and self-deducted when a wrong answer is clicked.
  Correct answers shown on the bottom of questions after options are clicked.
  When timer reachs 0, a form appears that asks user to provide initials.
  
Flaws:
  Self-deduction on only works as expected one time. Acceptance criteria asks to deduct 5 sec after every wrong answer.   But, user get deducted 5 sec first time. Second time they get deducted 10 and 15 and 20.
  Result Box shows up at the 4th question instead of the last question.
  Final score doesn't get retrieved and saved in Score Box. And Score Box doesn't show when click submit initials.
  
This's a pretty hard assignment for a beginner and has only 1 week to get done.
